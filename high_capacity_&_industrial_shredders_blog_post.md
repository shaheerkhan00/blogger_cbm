# High Capacity & Industrial Shredders: Safeguarding Your Sensitive Information

 Here is a draft 985-word blog post on High Capacity & Industrial Shredders:

The Critical Role of High Capacity & Industrial Shredders 

As data breaches and identity theft incidents continue rising, properly destroying sensitive documents is more critical than ever. High capacity and industrial shredders provide robust, reliable shredding to securely dispose of confidential information.

These heavy-duty machines can efficiently shred hundreds to thousands of sheets per hour, easily handling the increased shredding needs of busy offices, warehouses, government entities and any industry handling sensitive data.  

Key Capabilities of High Volume Shredders

Unlike typical office shredders, industrial and high capacity shredders feature hardened steel cutting shafts, powerful motors and large shred compartments to reliably shred for extended periods without overheating or jamming.

Key capabilities include:

- High throughput shredding from thousands to tens of thousands of sheets per hour
- Large entry openings and compartments holding hundreds of sheets 
- Ability to shred cardboard, CDs/DVDs, paper clips, staples
- Safe operation with auto start/stop, reverse and safety flap sensors   

Top Shredders for High Security and High Volume Needs

For fast and secure document destruction, here are some of our most powerful high capacity and industrial shredders:  

Dahle 20390 Oil-Free High Capacity Shredder
With throughput up to 41 feet per minute, this machine makes quick work of shredding projects. It can continuously run thanks to an energy-efficient, fan-cooled motor that prevents overheating.  

Dahle 20392 High Capacity Shredder  
This versatile machine offers 20 gallons of shred storage and can handle CDs, DVDs, paperclips, staples while providing Level 3 security strip-cut shredding.

Dahle 20396 High Capacity Shredder
Shredding up to 46 feet per minute, this shredder is ideal for processing large volumes fast. It features auto start/stop, reverse sensors and 25-gallon capacity.

Dahle PowerTEC 909 HS Industrial Shredder

Dahle PowerTEC 919 IS Industrial Shredder 
As one of the most powerful Dahle shredders, this monster machine shreds up to 205 sheets at once and offers 60 gallon capacity and incredible 118 feet per minute shredding, saving time on big shredding jobs.


Choosing the Right Shredder  

To find the right fit, consider:

- Security level - Strip-cut and micro-cut shredders meet higher security standards 
- Sheet capacity - More sheets per pass saves time for big jobs
- Run time - Continuous run times prevent overheating during long jobs  
- Specialty media - Some handle CDs, DVDs, hard drives, credit cards, etc
- Safety features - Look for auto start/stop, reverse, door sensors
- Bin/waste capacity - For longer unattended runtime  

For office settings without overly sensitive documents, level 3 strip cut models around 10-12 sheet capacity like smaller Dahle models offer solid performance at reasonable prices.  

Government entities, legal/healthcare firms, banks and any business dealing with very sensitive data should invest in a micro-cut or cross-cut shredder rated P-4 to P-7 for the highest security. Models like the Dahle 20390, 20392, 20396 and the PowerTEC industrial shredders meet the most stringent standards, even safeguarding top secret data.

Caring for Your Investment  

While these shredders are built for demanding workloads, taking care of your machine ensures longevity and safety:

- Avoid paper jams by not overfeeding
- Let cutting shafts fully stop before reversing  
- Follow lubricating oil guidelines 
- Inspect entry openings and receptors  
- Ensure door sensors function properly
- Keep air vents unclogged and motors clean
- Replace worn cutters when shred size increases

Don't Settle For Anything Less Than the Best

While destroying documents takes effort, itâ€™s infinitely easier and less costly than dealing with a data breach. Investing in a high quality, high capacity shredder suitable for your needs is a smart way to protect your clients, your reputation and your interests for years to come.
